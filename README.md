# Overview

Essentially a small budgeting app. Largely written because I wanted to try writing something personally useful in Haskell.

Currently designed to deal only with dollars. 

This will not be published on anywhere except GitHub at this stage. 

# Build and use. 

Build with stack :: `stack build` and `stack exec budget-tracker`. 

## CLI 

While running, you have access to the following commands (accessible via the `help` command):

- `help` -- displays information about accessible commands 
- ... 

## GUI 

Coming Soon TM (maybe)
